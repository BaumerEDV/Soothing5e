It is for this reason, we are proud to introduce a new skill for less murderous player characters: Soothing.</span></p><h2 class="c8" id="h.g0a2glp9bqkz"><span class="c1">How it Works</span></h2><h3 class="c5" id="h.lrsn7baucfqe"><span>What Happens when Soothing&nbsp;is Added to the Campaign</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Soothing is an additional Skill that is simply added to the list of available Skills in the game. It can be used for Ability Checks and you can gain Proficiency in it. Add it as a new entry in the skill list of all character sheets.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Soothing is added to the list of Skill Proficiencies players can pick from their class at Level 1 for the following Classes: Cleric, Monk, and Ranger.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If this Skill is added to an ongoing campaign, characters of these classes may exchange one of their Skill Proficiencies granted to them by their class for Soothing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Naturally, Soothing is available as a Background Skill choice for every character - just like every other skill.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Soothing is added to an ongoing campaign, characters may exchange one of their Skill Proficiencies gained from their Background for Soothing, provided they haven&rsquo;t exchanged a Class Skill Proficiency for it already.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.uxm0a2gitve5"><span class="c7">How it is Used</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c10">Soothing.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Your Charisma (Soothing) check covers attempts to diffuse or stall tense situations, such as when combat is ongoing but you want to initiate a truce, or when someone is about to do something most unwise out of desperation. Targets of Soothing attempts are never treated as hostile for the purposes of finding a DC for the attempt and resolving it - this makes Soothing significantly more effective than other Charisma skills in this situation when following the expanded rules for social interaction. If Persuasion or Intimidation would also be appropriate for such a check and you are also Proficient in that appropriate skill, your check is made at Advantage.</span></p><h2 class="c8" id="h.30w38zrl3f5x"><span class="c1">Legal Information</span></h2><h3 class="c5" id="h.8v71g0h9u3o6"><span class="c7">Notice of Open Game Content</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This material is covered by the Open Game License 1.0a.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.uukp4q1ilg1q"><span class="c7">Designation of Open Game Content</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">System Reference Document 5.1: Persuasion, Intimidation, Ability Checks, Proficiency, Cleric, Monk, Ranger, Level, Background, Charisma, Advantage.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.lfoxb2bncopo"><span class="c7">OPEN GAME LICENSE Version 1.0a</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The following text is the property of Wizards of the Coast, Inc. and is Copyright 2000 Wizards of the Coast, Inc (&quot;Wizards&quot;).
